Automates repetitive Data Science chores like importing libraries and reading data. Just do - from istart import * and It gives you the following:
   - imports as pd, np, plt, and all the modules from sklearn for quick start 
   - read_data(filename) #automatically reads through even a not so correct filename and detects type
   - convert() #automatically converts all "|" seperated txt files to excels (imported from databases for analysis/EDA)
   - import glob
   

I'm working on more! Let me know if you have suggestions.
